# Midily

Being musically creative is super easy. But being musically talented is not.

I want to make music, and I like to think I have a good grasp of what sounds good. I tend to think of cool basslines or melodies in my head, but I can't seem to play what's in my head on any particular instrument. This app will solve that problem.

Midily will record you singing a little melody. It will then convert that audio into a MIDI file. This means you can listen to that same melody on whatever instrument you want!

This is still a work in progress!
